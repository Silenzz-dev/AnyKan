# PLANKA Installer

Install PLANKA with one single command and a few questions.

## READ BEFORE INSTALL

**Do not run this installer on a server that is already in use.**

Since you need a fresh server, I recommend using Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian 12.

**Users who used the installer before October 11, 2023, should run the migration script.**

To do so, use the following command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plankanban/planka-installer/main/migration.sh -O /opt/installer_migration.sh && bash /opt/installer_migration.sh && rm -f /opt/installer_migration.sh
```

## Features

- Installs all required packages
- Installs PLANKA
- Configures Nginx reverse proxy
- Automates SSL certificates
- Automates backups
- Automates updates
- Configures Fail2Ban and Firewall
- Creates the first admin user

## Roadmap

- Clean up the code
- Consider additional features
